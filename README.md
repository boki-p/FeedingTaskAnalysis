**This repository is used for kinematic analyses for the feeding task. **
** The goal of the repo is to generate re-useable code for future data analysis.**

** BS. This is for my dissertation. :) **

**Update 01/22/2019:
Data processing script, added calculated variable called DistanceBtwCups. This will result in the kinematic_master sheet having one more column. 
I'm also considering organizing the output .mat file from the analysis.
